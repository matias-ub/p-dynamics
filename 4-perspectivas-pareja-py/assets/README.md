# Assets Directory

This directory is for static assets like images, fonts, and other static files.

Place your static files here, and they will be available at `/assets/filename` in your application.

## Examples:
- `/assets/logo.png` - Your application logo
- `/assets/favicon.ico` - Browser favicon
- `/assets/styles.css` - Custom CSS styles (if needed)
